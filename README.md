This is the code for "Self-Supervised Adversarial Hashing Networks for Cross-Modal Retrieval"  
The official code can be get from https://github.com/lelan-li/SSAH. 
The original code is built for tensorflow1 and python2. I modified it so that it can run on python3 and tensorflow2. Also I add some implementation details of this work, like how to get the dataset.
